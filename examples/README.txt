/synthetic_data/1D_Kuvshinov
This example illustrates:
(1) How to generate synthetic data;
(2) How to use perform separate and joint inversions.

/synthetic_data/1D_blocky
This example illustrates how different priors of layer conductivity (uniform distribution, smooth distribution) affect the posterior model distributions

/field_data/TUC
This folder illustrates a field data example at Tucson geomagnetic observatory

Edit setup.config and type the following command to run the inversion
